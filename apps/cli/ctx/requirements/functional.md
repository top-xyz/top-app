## Functional Requirements

This document outlines the functional requirements for the project. These requirements define what the system should be able to do and how it should behave.

### Introduction

This section provides a brief overview of the project and its goals. It should also identify the target audience for this document.

* **Project Overview:** Describe the project in a few sentences, including its purpose and intended use.
* **Target Audience:** Identify who will be using this document, such as developers, product managers, or stakeholders.

### Functional Requirements

This section details the specific functionalities the system must provide. Each requirement should be clearly stated, concise, and measurable. 

Here are some examples of functional requirements:

* The system shall allow users to create, edit, and delete accounts.
* The system shall provide a search function that allows users to find specific information.
* The system shall generate reports that summarize key data points.

For each requirement, consider including the following information:

* **Requirement ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement.
* **Description:** A clear and concise statement of the requirement.
* **Priority:** The importance of the requirement (e.g., high, medium, low).
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific criteria that must be met for the requirement to be considered complete.
* **Examples:** Practical examples of how the requirement will be used.

### Diagrams

If applicable, include diagrams in mermaid syntax to illustrate specific functionalities. This can help to clarify complex requirements and improve understanding.

### Next Steps

Once the functional requirements are finalized, the next steps are to:

* Develop technical specifications that detail how the system will be implemented.
* Create user stories that describe how users will interact with the system.
* Design the user interface and user experience.

This documentation provides a solid foundation for the development of the system. By clearly defining the functional requirements, we can ensure that the system meets the needs of its users and achieves its intended goals.
