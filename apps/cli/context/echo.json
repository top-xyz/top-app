This could be due to several reasons:\n\n- **Lack of training data:** The model might not have been trained on data related to AI-native approaches for enhancing conversational flow, automation, summarization, retrieval, and multimodality. \n- **Unclear prompt:** The prompt might be too broad or ambiguous for the model to understand the specific information being requested.\n- **Technical limitations:** The model might not have the capabilities to process and understand the complex concepts involved in the prompt.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n- **Provide more context:** Clarify the prompt by providing specific examples or use cases of AI-native approaches for enhancing conversational flow, automation, summarization, retrieval, and multimodality.\n- **Train the model on relevant data:** Train the model on data specifically related to AI-native approaches for enhancing conversational flow, automation, summarization, retrieval, and multimodality. This could include research papers, articles, or datasets containing information about these topics.\n- **Improve the model's capabilities:** Explore advanced techniques or models that can better understand and process complex concepts related to AI-native approaches for enhancing conversational flow, automation, summarization, retrieval, and multimodality.\n"
