# Design Documentation for pomo

## User Interface Design

The user interface for pomo will be glassy and minimal, with a focus on ease of use and clarity. The user interface will consist of four glowy glassy dots, representing the different stages of the pomodoro timer. There will also be start, pause, and stop buttons, as well as a progress bar to show how much time is remaining in the current session.

## User Experience Flow

The user experience flow for pomo will be as follows:

1. The user opens the app and enters the session length.
2. The user clicks the start button to begin the session.
3. The timer starts and the dots begin to fill in one by one.
4. The first dot disappears when the first work interval is complete.
5. The timer starts the short break when the first work interval is complete.
6. The user is done with the pomodoro session when all of the dots have disappeared.

## Design System

The design system for pomo will be based on the following principles:

* Clarity: The design should be clear and easy to understand.
* Simplicity: The design should be as simple as possible.
* Consistency: The design should be consistent across all screens and devices.

## Component Library

The component library for pomo will include the following components:

* Dot: A glowy glassy dot that represents a stage of the pomodoro timer.
* Button: A start, pause, or stop button.
* Progress bar: A progress bar that shows how much time is remaining in the current session.

## Design Decisions

The following design decisions were made based on the project context:

* The dots will be glowy and glassy to give the UI a more premium feel.
* The UI will be minimal to keep the focus on the timer itself.
* The controls will be instinctive to make the app easy to use.
* The app will be available online and for mobile devices.
