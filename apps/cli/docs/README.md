## Implementation Roadmap

This section outlines the development roadmap for the `pomo` project, a pomodoro macOS widget. It covers the key phases of development, dependencies, and implementation plan.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

* **Goal:** Establish the core infrastructure and functionalities.
* **Tasks:**
    * Set up the project environment and dependencies.
    * Implement the basic timer functionality (start, stop, reset).
    * Design and implement the user interface components.
    * Integrate with the macOS notification system.
    * Implement basic data storage and retrieval for timer settings.
    * Conduct initial user testing and gather feedback.

### Phase 2: Core Features (Months 3-4)

* **Goal:** Introduce additional features and enhance user experience.
* **Tasks:**
    * Implement project selection and management functionalities.
    * Integrate with a task management application (e.g., Todoist, Asana).
    * Develop a visual progress bar for tracking time.
    * Implement audio notifications for timer events.
    * Introduce customizable timer settings (e.g., work/break duration).
    * Enhance the user interface with animations and transitions.
    * Conduct further user testing and iterate based on feedback.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 5-6)

* **Goal:** Expand functionality and explore innovative features.
* **Tasks:**
    * Implement statistics and analytics for tracking productivity.
    * Integrate with other productivity tools and services.
    * Develop a gamification system for motivating users.
    * Introduce advanced timer modes (e.g., Pomodoro variants, custom intervals).
    * Explore voice control and accessibility features.
    * Conduct final user testing and prepare for release.

### Phase 4: Scaling & Optimization (Months 7-8)

* **Goal:** Ensure scalability, performance, and stability.
* **Tasks:**
    * Optimize the code for performance and resource efficiency.
    * Implement automated testing and continuous integration.
    * Monitor and address potential scalability issues.
    * Prepare documentation and release notes.
    * Launch the `pomo` widget on the macOS App Store.
    * Gather user feedback and iterate based on post-release data.

## Quality Gates

* **Performance Metrics:** Ensure the widget operates smoothly without significant performance impact on the system.
* **Quality Checks:** Implement unit tests for core functionalities and conduct manual testing for user interface and interactions.

## Risk Management

* **Technical Risks:** Address potential technical challenges such as integration with external services and compatibility with different macOS versions.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement continuous testing and monitoring to identify and address issues promptly.

## Dependencies

* **Essential:**
    * Swift 5.7 or later
    * Xcode 15 or later
    * macOS 13 or later
* **Optional:**
    * Integration with task management applications (e.g., Todoist, Asana)
    * Integration with other productivity tools and services
    * Third-party libraries for advanced features (e.g., analytics, gamification)

## Implementation Plan

* **Agile development methodology:** Utilize an iterative approach with short sprints and frequent feedback loops.
* **Version control system:** Use Git for code versioning and collaboration.
* **Project management tools:** Employ tools like Jira or Trello for task management and issue tracking.
* **Communication channels:** Establish clear communication channels between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
* **Continuous integration and deployment:** Implement automated builds and deployments to streamline the development process.

This roadmap provides a high-level overview of the development plan for the `pomo` project. Specific details and timelines may be adjusted based on ongoing development and feedback.
