## Non-Functional Requirements

This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the unnamed-project. 

### Introduction

Non-functional requirements define how the system should behave, rather than what it should do. They are crucial for ensuring the system meets user expectations and operates effectively in its intended environment.

### Categories of Non-Functional Requirements

This document addresses the following categories of non-functional requirements:

- **Performance:** Defines how the system should perform under various load conditions. This includes aspects like response times, throughput, and scalability.
- **Security:** Specifies the security measures needed to protect the system and its data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.
- **Usability:** Defines how easy and intuitive the system is to use for its intended users. This includes aspects like learnability, efficiency, and user satisfaction.
- **Reliability:** Specifies the system's ability to function correctly and consistently over time. This includes aspects like fault tolerance, recoverability, and mean time between failures (MTBF).
- **Maintainability:** Defines how easy it is to maintain and modify the system. This includes aspects like modularity, code quality, and documentation.
- **Portability:** Specifies the system's ability to be easily moved to different hardware or software environments.

### Specific Non-Functional Requirements

The following table outlines specific non-functional requirements for each category:

| Category | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Response time for critical transactions should be less than 2 seconds | Ensures users experience minimal delays when interacting with the system |
| Performance | The system should be able to handle a peak load of 1000 concurrent users | Ensures the system can scale to meet future demands |
| Security | All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit | Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access |
| Security | Access to the system should be controlled by a robust authentication and authorization mechanism | Ensures only authorized users can access the system and its data |
| Usability | The user interface should be intuitive and easy to learn | Minimizes the learning curve for new users |
| Usability | The system should provide clear and helpful error messages | Assists users in troubleshooting issues |
| Reliability | The system should be available 99.9% of the time | Minimizes downtime and ensures continuous operation |
| Reliability | The system should be able to recover from failures quickly and automatically | Minimizes the impact of system failures on users |
| Maintainability | The code should be well-documented and modular | Facilitates code maintenance and modification |
| Maintainability | The system should be easy to deploy and update | Reduces the effort required to maintain the system |
| Portability | The system should be able to run on different operating systems and hardware platforms | Provides flexibility for future deployments |

### Next Steps

- Review and finalize the non-functional requirements with stakeholders.
- Develop test cases to verify that the system meets the non-functional requirements.
- Document the non-functional requirements in a formal requirements document.

**Note:** This document provides a starting point for defining non-functional requirements. You should adapt and expand this document based on the specific needs of your project.
