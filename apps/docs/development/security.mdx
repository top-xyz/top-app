# Security Guidelines

Security is a top priority at Top. This guide outlines our security practices and requirements.

## Core Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security controls
   - No single point of failure
   - Comprehensive monitoring

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Minimal access rights
   - Role-based access control
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Zero Trust**
   - Verify every request
   - Encrypt all data in transit
   - Authenticate all connections

## Development Security

### Code Security

1. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding
   - Proper error handling
   ```typescript
   // Good
   const sanitizedInput = validateAndSanitize(userInput);
   // Bad
   const rawInput = userInput;
   ```

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Lock file maintenance
   ```bash
   # Run security audit
   pnpm audit
   # Update dependencies
   pnpm update
   ```

3. **Code Review**
   - Security-focused reviews
   - Automated scanning
   - Regular audits

### Data Security

1. **Data Classification**
   - Public data
   - Internal data
   - Sensitive data
   - Restricted data

2. **Data Protection**
   ```typescript
   // Encryption at rest
   const encrypted = await encrypt(sensitiveData, encryptionKey);
   
   // Encryption in transit
   const client = new Client({
     tls: true,
     cert: tlsCert
   });
   ```

3. **Data Retention**
   - Clear policies
   - Automated cleanup
   - Audit trails

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Firewall rules
   - Network segmentation
   - VPN requirements

2. **Monitoring**
   - Intrusion detection
   - Log analysis
   - Alert systems

3. **Compliance**
   - Regular audits
   - Certification maintenance
   - Policy enforcement

### Cloud Security

1. **Provider Security**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - IAM policies
   - Resource tagging

2. **Container Security**
   - Image scanning
   - Runtime protection
   - Network policies

3. **Key Management**
   - Rotation policies
   - Secure storage
   - Access logging

## Incident Response

1. **Preparation**
   - Response team
   - Communication plan
   - Recovery procedures

2. **Detection**
   - Monitoring systems
   - Alert thresholds
   - Investigation procedures

3. **Response**
   - Containment
   - Eradication
   - Recovery

## Security Testing

1. **Automated Testing**
```bash
# Run security tests
pnpm test:security

# Run penetration tests
pnpm test:pentest
```

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Code review
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability assessment

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Real-time alerts
   - Performance metrics
   - Security dashboards
