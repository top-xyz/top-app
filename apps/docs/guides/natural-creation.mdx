```text Example 1: Create a Landing Page
I want to create a landing page for my coffee shop. 
It should have a hero section with a large image of coffee beans, 
a menu section, and a contact form.
```

```text Example 2: Add Authentication
Add user authentication to my app using GitHub login.
Make sure it has a nice-looking login page.
```

Create an API endpoint that lets users submit coffee orders.

## Quick Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Instead of "make it look better", try "make the header larger and use a dark blue color"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Iterate Quickly">
    Start simple and refine. It's easier to say "now add a search bar" than describe everything at once.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use References">
    Link to examples you like: "make it look similar to airbnb.com"
  </Accordion>
