# Building with Top

Top is your creative companion that transforms ideas into working software through natural conversation. No coding required – just describe what you want to build, and watch it come to life.

## The Magic of Top

### Natural Creation
Imagine having a conversation with an expert developer who instantly understands your vision and brings it to life. That's Top. Simply describe what you want to build in plain English:

> "I want to create a social platform for book lovers where they can share reviews and create reading lists"

Top understands your intention and guides you through the creation process, showing you real-time previews of your app as it takes shape.

### Instant Reality
Every idea you share becomes reality in seconds:

1. **Describe your vision** - Use natural language to explain what you want to build
2. **See it come alive** - Watch as Top creates working previews of your app
3. **Refine and perfect** - Have a conversation to adjust and enhance your creation
4. **Share and deploy** - Make your app available to the world with one click

### Living Apps
Your app isn't static – it's a living creation that evolves with your vision:

- **Real-time updates** - Changes appear instantly as you describe them
