# App Interface Vision

## Overview

Top is reimagining the development environment as a collaborative workspace that brings together the best elements of modern tools:
- **Slack's** real-time team communication
- **Vercel's** seamless deployment workflow
- **Raycast's** command-driven interface
- **GitHub's** version control and collaboration

## Core Experience

### Smart Context Management

The app is built around the concept of "contexts" - intelligent workspaces that understand your development workflow:

- **Context Types**
  - Feature Development
  - Design System Work
  - Documentation
  - Team Communication
  - Code Review
  - Custom Contexts

- **Context Intelligence**
  - Auto-suggests relevant files and resources
  - Maintains development history
  - Connects related discussions and decisions
  - Provides AI-powered insights

### Three-Panel Interface

The interface is designed for fluid multitasking while maintaining focus:

1. **Navigation Bar (Left)**
   - Quick access to core functions
   - Visual indicators for activity
   - Seamless context switching
   - Global actions and settings

2. **Context Panel**
   - Active context management
   - Smart search and filtering
   - Team presence and activity
   - Context-specific tools

3. **Main Workspace**
   - Adaptive to current task
   - Rich previews and live collaboration
   - Contextual AI assistance
   - Seamless transitions
