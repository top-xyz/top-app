# Preview System Session

```prompt
I'm enhancing the preview system. Please help guide the implementation with:

Core References:
@11-preview-deployments.md - Preview deployment
@15-preview-architecture.md - System architecture
@12-context-preview-workflow.md - Preview workflow

System Context:
@08-notification-system.md - Status updates
@09-package-integrations.md - Package ecosystem
@22-action-execution.md - Action system

Work Context:
@work-log/daily/*/tasks/* - Active preview tasks
@work-log/progress.md - Preview system progress

Focus on instant, reliable previews with clear status updates and smooth deployment flow.
```
