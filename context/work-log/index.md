## Usage Guidelines

### Daily Logs
- Create a new directory for each day: `daily/YYYY/MM/DD/`
- Each task gets its own markdown file in the day's `tasks/` directory
- End each day with a summary in `summary.md`

Example daily structure:
```
daily/2024/01/15/
├── tasks/
│   ├── api-routes.md
│   ├── landing-page.md
│   └── docs-update.md
└── summary.md
```

### Weekly Reports
- Create a weekly summary: `weekly/YYYY/MM/week-N.md`
- Include:
  - Key accomplishments
  - Challenges faced
  - Next week's goals
  - Resource needs
  - Team updates

### Task Tracking
- Long-running tasks get their own files in `tasks/`
- Track:
  - Progress
  - Blockers
  - Dependencies
  - Related PRs
  - Notes
