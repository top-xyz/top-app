    U[User Input] --> A[API Route]
    A --> V[Vertex AI]
    V --> S[SSE Stream]
    S --> C[Client]
    
    A --> R[Redis Cache]
    R --> A
```

### Context API Structure
```typescript
// Core API routes
api/
  ├── contexts/
  │   ├── [id]/
  │   │   ├── messages/  // Message handling
  │   │   ├── actions/   // Action execution
  │   │   └── previews/  // Preview management
  │   └── route.ts      // Context CRUD
  └── health/          // Health checks
```

### Documentation Architecture
```typescript
interface DocGenerator {
  // Convert context to Mintlify MDX
  generateMDX(context: Context): MDXContent
  // Extract code examples
  extractExamples(context: Context): CodeExample[]
  // Create API references
  generateAPIRef(context: Context): APIReference
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Add more preset prompts
2. Enhance error handling
3. Implement analytics
4. Add A/B testing for responses
5. Fix package exports (@repo/auth, @repo/database)
6. Implement AI pipeline integration
7. Add real-time updates with WebSocket
8. Add rate limiting
9. Implement documentation auto-generation
10. Create core concept guides
11. Build API reference pages
