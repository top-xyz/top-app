# Task: Documentation System Reorganization
Date: 2024-01-16

## Objective
Improve documentation organization by consolidating the context-to-docs concept into the main documentation system and establishing a better work log structure.

## Progress
- [x] Consolidated context-to-docs
  - Created comprehensive Living Documentation System guide
  - Integrated technical implementation details
  - Updated meta ideas index
  - Preserved core concepts and philosophy
- [x] Created work log structure
  - Set up daily/weekly/task directories
  - Created templates for consistency
  - Added usage guidelines
  - Established best practices

## Notes
- The context-to-docs concept was more mature than initially thought, warranting direct integration into core docs
- Work log structure designed to support:
  - Daily task tracking
  - Weekly summaries
  - Long-running task documentation
  - Progress metrics
- Templates will help maintain consistency and completeness in logging

## Decisions Made
1. Moved context-to-docs from ideas to core documentation
2. Structured work logs by date and task type
3. Added templates for different log types
4. Kept progress.md as main tracker

## Questions/Considerations
- Should we add automation for creating daily log directories?
- Consider adding PR/commit links to task logs
- Might need analytics integration for progress tracking

## Next Steps
- Start using new work log structure consistently
- Consider creating scripts for log management
- Review and update progress.md weekly
- Add more cross-references between related logs
