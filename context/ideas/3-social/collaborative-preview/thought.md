## Vision

Transform development into a living, breathing social experience where creators seamlessly flow between individual focus and collaborative synergy. The system should feel like a digital creative studio where ideas, code, and previews become a shared canvas for real-time collaboration and innovation.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Living Workspaces
- Real-time presence awareness
- Multi-user cursor tracking
- Shared context navigation
- Dynamic role management
- Ambient activity indicators

### 2. Social Preview System
- Live collaborative previews
- In-preview chat and comments
- Visual annotations and markers
- Shared interaction history
- Multi-user testing flows

### 3. Context Sharing
- Branching and merging contexts
- Public/private workspace modes
- Context access controls
- Team synchronization
- Cross-context communication

### 4. Creative Streams
- Live coding broadcasts
- Preview demonstrations
- Interactive sessions
- Knowledge sharing
- Community engagement

### 5. Collaborative Intelligence
- Group activity analysis
- Smart work distribution
- Conflict prevention
- Suggestion aggregation
- Team pattern learning

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Traditional Collaboration Tools
- Context-aware interactions
- Seamless preview sharing
- Intelligent workspace management
- Natural communication flow
- Real-time synchronization

### vs. Current Dev Environments
- Social coding experience
- Live preview collaboration
- Cross-context sharing
- Team intelligence
- Community integration
