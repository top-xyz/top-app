## Vision

Create a fluid, transparent context management system that dynamically discovers, suggests, and manages relevant resources as users work. Unlike traditional IDEs with static documentation configs, Top should feel like a living knowledge graph that grows and adapts with each project.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Dynamic Resource Discovery
- Auto-detect dependencies, frameworks, and libraries in use
- Proactively fetch relevant documentation and resources
- Monitor code changes to suggest new relevant resources
- Learn from user interactions to improve suggestions

### 2. Transparent Context Building
- Show users what resources are being added/removed and why
- Provide clear visibility into how context is being used
- Allow easy modification of context sources
- Maintain history of context changes

### 3. Flexible Resource Management
- Allow adding/removing resources on the fly
- Support multiple types of resources:
  - Documentation (MDX, Markdown, etc.)
  - Code repositories
  - API references
  - External websites
  - Community resources
  - User annotations

### 4. Smart Suggestions
- Analyze code patterns to suggest relevant docs
- Learn from user feedback on suggestions
- Consider project context when suggesting resources
- Prioritize suggestions based on current task

### 5. Automatic Context Enrichment
- Monitor package.json changes
- Watch for new imports/dependencies
- Track API usage patterns
- Observe coding patterns

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Traditional IDEs
- Dynamic vs static documentation
- Project-specific vs global settings
- Transparent vs opaque context building
- Active vs passive resource discovery

### vs. Cursor
- Per-project vs global documentation
- Dynamic vs manual resource management
- Transparent vs hidden configuration
- Integrated vs separate context management

## Integration Points

### Package System
```typescript
// @packages/ai for smart suggestions
// @packages/cms for resource management
// @packages/database for context persistence
// @packages/analytics for usage tracking
```

### Core Systems
```typescript
// @apps/api for context management
// @apps/app for user interface
// @apps/docs for documentation integration
```

## User Experience Goals

1. **Transparency**
   - Show what resources are available
   - Explain why resources were added
   - Make context visible and modifiable

2. **Flexibility**
   - Easy to add/remove resources
   - Support multiple resource types
   - Allow custom organization

3. **Intelligence**
   - Smart suggestions
   - Automatic discovery
   - Learning from usage

4. **Integration**
   - Seamless workflow
   - Natural interactions
   - Minimal configuration

## Technical Considerations

1. **Resource Indexing**
   - Fast search and retrieval
   - Efficient updates
   - Smart caching

2. **Context Building**
   - Incremental updates
   - Dependency tracking
   - Change monitoring

3. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading
   - Background processing
   - Resource prioritization
