#social #growth #community

## Core Philosophy

Like football itself, our social media presence should be:
- **Authentic** not manufactured
- **Intelligent** not pretentious
- **Community-driven** not broadcast-focused
- **Quality-focused** not metrics-obsessed
- **Culturally resonant** not trend-chasing

      frequency: "Real-time during matches + 3-4 daily insights"
    }
