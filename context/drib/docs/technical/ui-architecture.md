## Architecture Overview

### 1. Component Architecture
```typescript
interface ComponentSystem {
  atomic: {
    atoms: "Base UI elements"
    molecules: "Composite components"
    organisms: "Feature sections"
    templates: "Page layouts"
    pages: "Route components"
  }
  
  patterns: {
    server_components: "Default server-first"
    client_components: "Interactivity focused"
    islands: "Hydration strategy"
  }
}
```

### 2. State Management Strategy
```typescript
interface StateStrategy {
  global: {
    user: "Preferences & settings"
    theme: "UI customization"
    navigation: "Route state"
  }
  
  feature: {
    match: "Live game state"
    analysis: "Current insights"
    social: "Community interaction"
  }
  
  local: {
    forms: "Input management"
    modals: "UI state"
    animations: "Motion state"
  }
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimizations
```typescript
interface Performance {
  loading: {
    streaming: "Component streaming"
    suspense: "Loading boundaries"
    skeleton: "Content placeholders"
  }
  
  caching: {
    static: "Static page caching"
    dynamic: "Data caching"
    revalidation: "Cache strategies"
  }
  
  optimization: {
    images: "Next/Image with optimization"
    fonts: "Custom font loading"
    bundles: "Code splitting"
  }
}
```

## Feature Implementation

### 1. Smart Dashboard
```typescript
interface DashboardArchitecture {
  components: {
    grid: "Dynamic grid system"
    widgets: "Customizable components"
    controls: "Interactive elements"
  }
  
  features: {
    customization: "Layout persistence"
    realtime: "Live updates"
    interaction: "Drag and drop"
  }
  
  optimization: {
    virtualization: "Large dataset handling"
    prefetching: "Predictive loading"
    caching: "State persistence"
  }
}
```

### 2. Match Experience
```typescript
interface MatchInterface {
  core: {
    timeline: "Match progression"
    stats: "Live statistics"
    analysis: "AI insights"
  }
  
  interaction: {
    controls: "Playback control"
    filters: "Data visualization"
    sharing: "Social features"
  }
  
  performance: {
    streaming: "Real-time data"
    rendering: "Smooth animations"
    memory: "Efficient updates"
  }
}
```

### 3. Analysis Engine
```typescript
interface AnalysisUI {
  visualization: {
    pitch: "Interactive pitch view"
    heatmaps: "Performance data"
    networks: "Player connections"
  }
  
  controls: {
    timeline: "Time-based analysis"
    comparison: "Multi-game analysis"
    filters: "Data selection"
  }
  
  export: {
    reports: "Analysis export"
    sharing: "Social sharing"
    embedding: "External use"
  }
}
```

## Design System Integration

### 1. ShadCN Enhancement
```typescript
interface ShadcnExtension {
  base: {
    theme: "Football-focused palette"
    typography: "Sport-optimized scale"
    spacing: "Consistent grid"
  }
  
  components: {
    data: "Enhanced tables & charts"
    media: "Video & image handling"
    forms: "Complex inputs"
  }
  
  patterns: {
    layouts: "Sport-specific patterns"
    interactions: "Touch-optimized"
    feedback: "Real-time updates"
  }
}
```

### 2. Custom Components
```typescript
interface DribComponents {
  pitch: {
    view: "Interactive pitch"
    overlay: "Data visualization"
    controls: "Analysis tools"
  }
  
  stats: {
    cards: "Key metrics"
    charts: "Performance graphs"
    tables: "Detailed data"
  }
  
  social: {
    threads: "Discussions"
    sharing: "Content distribution"
    collaboration: "Group analysis"
  }
}
```
